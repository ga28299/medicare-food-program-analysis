## Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of food access challenges using CDC and FDA public datasets. The project explores potential strategies for a Medicare Advantage plan to address food insecurity among its members.


## Objectives
- Work with messy data from public data sources
- Identify optimal locations for deploying a food access program
- Estimate the number of people who could be included and can benefit
- Determine which subgroups might benefit most from the program
- Project the potential impact of the program
